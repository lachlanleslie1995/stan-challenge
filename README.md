    Stan Coding Challenge

    Setting up the application
    Requirements:
    Nodejs
    npm (Comes with node)

    Running the application



    How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

        - I chose to approach this app in a TDD (Test Driven Development) way as I believe it helps create tidier code with fewer dependencies and less bugs.
        - As it is a small and simple application I chose to use parcel-bundler for building/deployment due to its speed and ease of configuration
        - Used a combination of React-testing-library and jest because they're simple to use and easy to read if you're not familiar with it/the person who wrote the. Also jests error messages are really good.
        - Structure of the app???? (Header + footer and only re-render the body of the page)
        - I chose to use reach-router over react-router as it has more features catered to accessibility while still being a small and simple router.
        - Chose "not" to lazy load as this is a simple small app
        - Discuss structure of components and why it was broken down the way it was

    Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

    What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
